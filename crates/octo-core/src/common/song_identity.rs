//! One reading of song titles and artist credits for every place Octo decides whether two
//! songs are the same. Port of `Services/Common/SongIdentity.cs`.
//!
//! The C# took `string?` almost everywhere and read null as empty. The Rust takes `&str` for
//! those (pass `""` for null) and keeps an `Option` only where null meant something else: the
//! artist of [`SongIdentity::parse_title`], where null reads the title alone and empty means
//! the song has no artist.
//!
//! Regex notes. The `regex` crate has no lookaround, so the four C# patterns that used it are
//! matched in two steps that give the same answer: the track-number lookahead is a captured
//! character, the `x` separator's negative lookahead is checked after the match (and the search
//! resumes one character on, as the backtracking engine would), and the `VEVO` lookbehind is
//! tested by hand. Leftmost-first alternation and lazy quantifiers agree with .NET's
//! backtracking. Where the Unicode classes do not agree, the pattern is run over a same-length
//! view of the text: [`word_boundary_view`] for `\b` (.NET's word characters are letters,
//! nonspacing marks, digits and connectors in one UTF-16 unit; Rust's also take spacing marks
//! and supplementary letters), [`utf16_class_view`] for `\d` and `\p{L}` (.NET never matched a
//! supplementary-plane character with either). Case-insensitive patterns agree with .NET's
//! invariant culture, which is what the container runs (no `LANG`): under en-US, .NET's `(?i)i`
//! would also match `İ`.
//!
//! Every public function here was compared with the C# on two generated corpora of about 25,000
//! titles, credits and pairs each (all of song-identity-cases.json, plus mixed scripts, marks,
//! supplementary characters, brackets and separators), with no difference.
