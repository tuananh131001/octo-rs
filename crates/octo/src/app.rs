//! The application's shared state: one `Arc` per service, standing in for the singletons
//! `Program.cs` registered with ASP.NET's container.
//!
//! # Adding a service (the pattern every porter follows)
//!
//! 1. Add a field to [`AppInner`], holding the service as `Arc<YourService>` (or a type that is
//!    already a cheap handle). Name it after the C# class in snake case
//!    (`SubsonicProxyService` → `subsonic_proxy`), and put a `///` line on it naming the C#
//!    registration it replaces.
//! 2. Construct it in [`AppState::build`] (production) **and** in [`AppState::for_tests`]
//!    (handler tests), in dependency order. A service the C# resolved eagerly at startup
//!    (`app.Services.GetRequiredService<T>()` in `Program.cs`) is built here; a lazily built one
//!    is still built here, which is fine unless its constructor does I/O.
//! 3. A C# class registered "Singleton AND hosted" is one `Arc` field plus a worker:
//!    register its loop with `state.workers.register("Name", ...)` in [`AppState::build`],
//!    capturing a clone of the `Arc`. Never start work from a constructor.
//! 4. Settings: services read `state.settings.current()` at the point of use
//!    (`IOptionsMonitor`), or copy a value out in their constructor and say so (`IOptions`).
//!
//! Handlers take `State(state): State<AppState>` and reach services as `state.settings`,
//! `state.restart_tracker`, ... through [`Deref`](std::ops::Deref).
