//! Port of `DownloadAttributionTests`: attribution has to survive the one thing that makes it
//! interesting, two people wanting the same track. The queue deduplicates by track, so the second
//! star joins a transfer that is already running rather than starting another, and anything that
//! reads the requester at enqueue time would credit whoever happened to win that race and drop the
//! rest.
