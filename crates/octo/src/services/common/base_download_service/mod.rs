//! Port of `Services/Common/BaseDownloadService.cs`.
//!
//! The C# was an abstract base class: the download pipeline every source shares, with the
//! source-specific parts as abstract and virtual members a subclass (`SoulseekDownloadService`)
//! overrode. Here the shared machinery is [`BaseDownloadService`], a struct, and the overridable
//! members are the [`DownloadBackend`] trait it calls back into. A backend gets the base on every
//! call, so it reaches the same protected members a subclass did (`download_path`, `track`,
//! `notifications`, `services`, ...). `BaseDownloadService` implements [`IDownloadService`].
//!
//! The members a subclass reached through `OptionalService<T>()` and the service provider are
//! the fields of [`DownloadServices`], each `None` where the C# found no such service.
//!
//! The C# file is split here by topic: this module holds the download, the album walk and the
//! bookkeeping; `placement` where a file goes; `tagging` what it is and what is written to it.
