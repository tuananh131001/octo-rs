//! Port of `Services/IDownloadService.cs`: the music download service's interface and
//! `DirectStreamInfo`. The service itself is 4-B's `BaseDownloadService` and 4-C's
//! `SoulseekDownloadService`.
//!
//! The C# methods threw where a download could not be done; here they answer `Err`, and a
//! caller that branches on the kind downcasts (`ReplacementRejectedException`).
